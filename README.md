# Code Lens

Code Lens is a tool to visualize and understand codebases. It's composed of two main parts: a web interface and an agent.

- [Web](./web/README.md): The frontend application for visualizing the code.
- [Agent](./agent/README.md): The backend agent that analyzes the code and provides the data for visualization.
