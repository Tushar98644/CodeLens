# Agent

This directory contains the backend agent for Code Lens. It's responsible for analyzing the codebase and providing the data for visualization to the frontend.

## Getting Started

To get the agent running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

2.  **Run the agent:**
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```

    This will start the agent on port 8123.

## Architecture

The agent is built with TypeScript and uses the following key technologies:

-   **LangChain/LangGraph:** For creating the agentic RAG pipeline.
-   **CopilotKit:** For integrating AI-powered features.
-   **Zod:** For schema validation.
